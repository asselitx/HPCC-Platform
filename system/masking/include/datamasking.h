/**
 * @brief Interface used by a profile to request additional context from the caller when deciding
 *        whether a specific markup value requires masking.
 *
 * A profile consumer provides an instance of this interface to a profile when requesting masking,
 * or masking information, related to markup values. The profile uses the instance to resolve
 * "external" masking dependencies, meaning when the decision to mask one value depends on another
 * value or on its location relative to other markup.
 *
 * For each value defined with external dependencies, the profile will negotiate the number of
 * ancestral elements (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, et al) that are available for
 * dependency resolution. The profile declares a number it wants to use, and the instance responds
 * with the number actually available, if less than the number requested. Reasons why the number
 * available is less than the number requested include:
 *
 * - The value occurred at a shallower document depth than requested.
 * - The instance is incapable of either detecting or accessing the requested elements. Consider
 *   limitations arising from `IPropertyTree`'s inability to access parent nodes for illustration.
 *
 * Bound by the negotiated node limit, the profile can request two types of data:
 *
 * 1. An XPath evaluation to a text value. This is used to resolve dependencies on related data.
 *    For example, if the value of element *A* is conditionally masked depending on the value of
 *    sibling element *B*, the parent of *A* can be asked for the value of its child named *B*;
 *    the use of XPath syntax like `../B` to access *B* directly from *A* is discouraged since it
 *    is not universally supported.
 * 2. Ancestral element names can be requested. This is used to resolve "contained by" dependencies.
 *    For example, if the value of element *A* is conditionally masked depending on the name of
 *    it's parent element, the parent of *A* can be asked for its name. This relationship can be
 *    extended to as many levels as are available.
 *
 * The need to mask a value can be confirmed by the profile if the profile successfully matches
 * all parts of at least one dependency. Each value with a dependency may have multiple, discrete
 * dependencies configured - either the value of *A* is masked if the value of *B* is one of a set
 * of values, or the value of *A* is masked if the name of *A*'s parent is one of a set of values.
 *
 * The need to mask a value can be rejected by the profile if the profile fails to match at least
 * one part of all dependencies.
 *
 * The need to mask a value is ambiguous if at least one part of a dependency cannot be evaluated.
 * The absence of data with access to the complete document content may strongly suggest that
 * masking is not necessary, but may not conclusively prove it. An inability to evaluate data makes
 * a decision for or against masking nothing but a guess. Handling of the ambiguity is an exercise
 * for the profile, possibly accepting context properties to influence the decision.

 *
 * - `maskValue` masks individual values based on an masker-defined meanings. For example, a

 *   appears.
 * - `maskContent` masks a variable number of values based on context provided by surrounding text.
 *   For example, the value of an HTTP *authentication* header or the text between `<Password>` and
 *   `</Password>` might require masking. This operation can apply to both structured and
 *   unstructured text content.
 * - `maskMarkupValue` masks individual values based on their locationa within an in-memory
 *   representation of a structured document, such as XML or JSON. For example, the value of
 *   element `Password` might require masking unconditionally, while the value of element `Value`
 *   might require masking only if a sibling element named `Name` exists with value *password*.
 *   This operation relies on the caller's ability to supply context parsed from structured

 * - `maskOffset` will be less than `offset + length`
 * - `maskLength` will not be more than `length`
 * - `maskOffset + maskLength` will not be more than `offset + length`
 * - `valueType` will identify the nature of the given value
 * - `maskStyle` will identify the mask style used to calculate both `maskOffset` and `maskLength`
 * - Use `buffer`, `maskOffset`, `maskLength`, and `valueType` (with the default mask style) to mask
 *   the required character range.
 * - Use `buffer`, `offset`, `length`, and `maskStyle` to mask the required character range,
 *   recalculating `maskOffset` and `maskLength` in the process.
 *
 * Consider an account number for which all but the last four digits require masking. A request for
 * markup value info will identify the given value's type and the value substring to be masked. It
 * may also identify a non-default mask style used to calculate the substring. Applying a mask
 * using `valueType` and the default mask style touches only the characters to be masked. Because
 * `maskStyle` identified the value substring to be masked, asking it to mask the value requires it
 * to repeat the substring identification process; supplying only the substring to the style would
